## @shakesco/userop

This repository makes it easy for developers to create userop that can be sent 
to bundlers for execution!

To install:
```shell
npm i @shakesco/userop
```

After installing:
```javascript
const shakesco = require("@shakesco/userop");
```

To send a user operation or intents you need:
1. __Sender__ - This is the smart account
2. __Nonce__ - This is the smart accounts number of intent sent from deployment
3. __initCode__ - This is the code used to deploy the sender if not yet on-chain.
4. __callData__ - Data that you want the smart account to execute
5. __callGasLimit__ - Gas limit for the execution phase
6. __verificationGasLimit__ - Gas limit for the verification phase
7. __preVerificationGas__ - Gas to compensate the bundler for the overhead to submit the User Operation.
8. __maxFeePerGas__ - Similar to eip 1559
9. __maxPriorityFeePerGas__ - Similar to eip 1559
10. __paymasterAndData__ - The paymaster plus data used to sponsor transaction and verify legibility
11. __signature__ - The signature of from the owner of the smart wallet.

So let's start with nonce because sender is pretty straightforward.
To get the nonce call the function below from your smart account:

```javascript
const ACCOUNT = new ethers.Contract(sender, smartWalletABI, provider);
const nonce = await ACCOUNT.getNonce();
```

>ðŸ““NOTE: This assumes you have deployed smart wallet. If not populate nonce with "0x0"

To get the initcode you need the [_factory_](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccountFactory.sol "Factory") contract. You can create the initcode by simply doing:

```javascript
    const factory = new ethers.Interface(accountFactoryABI);
    const initCode = ethers.concat([
      accountFactoryAddress,
      factory.encodeFunctionData("deployWallet", [
        owner, //owner of the smart wallet
        "0", //salt.
      ]),
    ]);
```

The calldata is the function you want to execute. So you encode the function as below:

```javascript
const accountABI = new ethers.Interface(smartWalletABI);

const calldata = accountABI.encodeFunctionData("execute", 
    [
        address,
        ethers.parseEther(value),
        "0x",
    ]);
```

The above calldata is a simple one requesting the smart wallet to send eth to address.

Now to the gas value:

Use our package to get the eip 1559 gas value as below:

```javascript
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(
    process.env.RPC_URL
  );
  const { maxFeePerGas, maxPriorityFeePerGas } = await shakesco.getEIP1559(
    provider
  );
  console.log(maxFeePerGas); //0x1000000016
  console.log(maxPriorityFeePerGas); //0x1000000000
```

To get the other userop gas value:

```javascript
  const { callGasLimit, preVerificationGas, verificationGasLimit } =
    await shakesco.useropGasValues(
      smartWallerAddress,
      provider,
      calldata,
      initCode
    );
  console.log(callGasLimit); //0x83074
  console.log(preVerificationGas); //0x21000
  console.log(verificationGasLimit); //0x100000
```
>ðŸ““NOTE: If smart wallet deployed pass initcode as empty string. If you also don't want to call any data from the smart wallet pass an empty string.

Finally we need to sign the userop so as to send the userop. We can do this by:

```javascript
 const arraifiedHash = shakesco.useropHash(
    smartWallerAddress,
    nonce,
    initCode,
    calldata,
    callGasLimit,
    verificationGasLimit,
    preVerificationGas,
    maxFeePerGas,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas,
    paymasterAndDataNOSIG,
    chainId
  );
  console.log(arraifiedHash);
```
After getting the hash we can sign this by doing:

```javascript	
   const signer = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIV_KEY, provider);
   const signature = await signer.signMessage(arraifiedHash);
```
>ðŸ““NOTE: This assumes that you passed one owner while deploying wallet. If using multi-signature or Threshold signatures this will not work.

You now have all the value to send the userop. Pass them as required by your bundler provider.
